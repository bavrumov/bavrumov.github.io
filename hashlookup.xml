			Often time the first blog post is what loses any potential reader. If post #1 is garbage, there's 0 incentive to read post #2, on the off chance it gets better. After all, why would a reader gamble (against terrible odds) with their time like that? That's a lot of pressure for me, the author of this first post.<br /><br />
			I often get lost in this kind of self reflection, and the inexplicable fear of failure. And so, I'm trapped in a cyclical paradox. If I reflect, I might cripple my ability to move forward in my endeavors. If I don't reflect, then I'm not learning or thinking enough, nor am I planning for my future. The clich√© answer is to "find balance," and for me that took the form of being more impulsive. After taking a backseat for a long time, I've become more ready to try new things and put myself out into the world. I'm enjoying trying new things and putting myself in new situations (in school, at work, in friendships) and I'm proud for making this change. <br /><br />
			I think it's important for this post to exist, to frame the future posts with some personal context. And in a few years when I look back at the post, I'll see how far along I've come. Maybe by then I've 100% resolved the paradox too, in which case good job me!<br /><br /><hr />
			Side-note: I am taking a class called "Paradoxes and Limits of Knowledge" which explores paradoxical ways of thinking, along with reasons they arise and how to avoid them. Cool coincidence, might inspire a full future post.<hr />
			Second side-note: This is post #0, and was written on February 2, 2017. Good work finding it.

			You unlocked the Random Desktop‚Ñ¢ 
			What's that mean? It means that every X seconds, the desktop becomes a random color.
			And you get to pick how many seconds that is: x = <input type="text" value="5"/>
			<button onclick="holoDesktop(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Start</button>
			<button onclick="holoDesktop(0);">Stop</button><hr />
			(It also means if you're prone to seizures don't enter a small number, for your safety.)<br />
			If you want to change the timing, press Stop before modifying the number.

			HAPPY VALENTINES DAY IVY! Idk if you have a valentine this year but I gotchu as honorary valentine, none of my friends are ever alone. EVERYBODY GETS SOME LOVE. I could literally go on about how special you are for a long time but like it's 12:09 AM as I write this and I need to write everyone else's valentine stuff. DAS RIGHT BAAYBEEEE I made a thing for everyone in the suite. I know I'm a cornball for this but I wanted to share the love and good vibes that I feel everytime I see one of my favorite photos:<br />
			<div style="width:100%">
				<p style="display:inline-block; width:45%; float:right;"><img src="./photo/stony.jpg" height="220px" alt="frands"/></p>
				<p style="display:inline-block; width:45%">
					So yeah here's a password for everyone in the suite, I'll leave it to you to show them the passwords or whatever. I'd prefer if everyone's thing was personal? But I can't enforce that in any way so that's on your conscience. Highlight past a name for their password: (no spaces in any of em, case sensitive)</p>
			</div>
			<li>Brittny <span style="color:white">BRITVAL</span></li>
			<li>Michelle <span style="color:white">ruskiypolitik</span></li>
			<li>Ming <span style="color:white">mysteryming</span></li>
			<li>Olivia <span style="color:white">olive-you</span></li>
			It's an alphabetical list by the way, before I'm accused of playing favorites.<hr />
			SIKE I'm gonna go on about how special you are &lt;3<br />
			I'm OD glad you pick up my stupid phone calls and pretend to be enthusiastic. And you listen to any foolish ramblings I have. Like I'm literally wasting your time and you allow it. Even when you dissappear from my life you always reappear in some big way and its the best. I know I have a really good friend to turn to if my life ever goes to shit, and I'm glad that we can joke about eachother and about a lot of things and everything is good. You barely made fun of me for seeing a yugioh movie like cmon I'm a loser. Even though I expect snaps from you everyday (to maintain our most important streak) your name popping up on my lock screen still makes me smile.<br />
			HAPPY VALENTINES DAY IVY üçÄ

			I feel like we secretly have a lot in common. We LOWKEY have similar music tastes (you mentioned a few bands that night I was there and in my drunken stupor I ackowledged I liked them too but can't remember any specific ones). Slytherin is of course the best house hands-down. I don't think you mentioned fall out boy but I feel like we both enjoy their music. I could be wrong though and seem really pretentious. Forgive.
			<br /><br />
			I definitely had more conversations with you than anyone else (not including Ivy obviously but cmon I already knew her) but AGAIN I CAN'T REMEMBER SHIT i just remember a really sincere and genuine vibe. And those are the best vibes to get from people. I'm an introvert and I appreciate that you weren't loud or overbearing. It can be hard for me to just casually start talking to people but I was really comfortable when you and I spoke. So happy valentine's day Brittny and I hope your life has been as gr8 as you are.

			From: Boris<br />
			I love when you/your friends put up snap stories where you sing. Sometimes I hear a great song and im like fuck I want to know how Olivia would make this song her BITCH. From the moment I saw you smile (you came to the party last so its forever imprinted in my mind) I was like damn this is just a good human being I'm about to meet. My first impressions are usually 100% garbage but I'm glad with you I was right. You seem really responsible and wholesome and I always felt safe in your dorm. Anyone who laughs at my jokes is a friend of mine so you're good in my books. It's wild that you know some of my macaulay friends at brooklyn college, and i'm lowkey jealous that they met you before I did.<br />
			I'm OD obsessed with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMA1D3eGkE4">kids bop version of let me love you</a> (don't judge) and I'm also losing my shit to Shape of you (the ed sheeran song everyone is obsessing over). I'm listening to it rn as I write this but I feel like YOU singing the chorus WOULD be better. Thanks for being a source of happiness! Happy Valentines day Olivia!!!!! Sorry your password had to be a terrible pun don't shoot me

			Your snaps stories are usually entertaining. I really admire that you've learned Russian and French (and maybe even more I don't know you well enough), it's one of the reasons I decided to take a new language this semester (Italian).<br />
			Everytime I ask my friends to drink they're like "no I gotta study" or "dude it's 9 am what is wrong with you" and I don't need that kind of negativity in my life. I think you're a fantastic drinking buddy and I get an adventurous, funny vibe from you. I appreciate that you've been a good friend to me, and you're a great friend to Ivy. I always know she's in good hands. The snapstreak we had for like 3 seconds was pretty cool too. You probably got a bunch of valentines so I'll keep this one short, KEEP BEING U AND HAPPY VALENTINES DAY B!!

			YO YOU'RE STILL A MYSTERY TO ME LIKE I know you forged a brooklyn tech diploma because i checked the yearbook and you're not there.<br />
			Jokes though, I'm glad I can say I'm friends with Ming Chen. There's a handful of photos of your butt in my face so that means I trust you at the most fundamental level, and that's a special bond I don't share with many people. Why can't anyone like your profile picture? Why haven't I gotten to know you better? Why didn't we talk in high school? Why was your last message to me "You must got some a1 vision then"? So many questions but I enjoy the mysterious air around you.<br />
			One thing isn't a mystery though, and that thing is today is February 14, 2017. So HAPPY valentines day to you Ming. You're a lovely human.
